# **ML Models for Small Bioactive Molecules**  
**August 2024 - December 2024**  

**Associated with Break Through Tech AI @ MIT, Cornell University**  
**Project realized by Alex Lapadat, Blair Kuzniarek, Ha Dong, Ray Qin, Tiffney Aina**

This project is part of the **AI Studio Challenge** presented by **Alkermes**, focusing on generating AutoML models for small molecule bioactive compounds using **ChEMBL** data. The primary goal is to predict molecular properties and evaluate prediction confidence, which is essential for drug discovery and compound nomination.

## **Objectives**

- **Compound Structure Analysis**: Use compound structure-derived descriptors as inputs for the models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Apply Python, Scikit-learn, and deep learning tools for building and optimizing models.
- **Automated Model Building**: Automate the process of building, evaluating, and deploying predictive models.
- **Conformal Prediction**: Implement conformal prediction techniques to quantify model confidence.
- **Batch Processing Interface**: Create an interface for batch processing and quantitative assessments of molecular activity.
